#Distribution of Total and Per Capita Emissions in Argentina and the AMBA

This project analyzes the distribution of total and per capita emissions across Argentina, with a progressive focus starting at the national level, moving into a detailed analysis of Buenos Aires Province and City, and concluding with a specific study of the AMBA region (Greater Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires City).

To develop this analysis, an R script available in this repository was used, integrating tools such as tidyverse, terra, and sf. Global emissions data were sourced from the EDGAR database, while population data were obtained from the GHSL dataset.

The analysis begins with a map of total emissions, which logically reflects higher concentrations in densely populated and industrialized areas, such as Buenos Aires Province, Santa Fe, Córdoba, and, to a lesser extent, Mendoza. On the other hand, the map that accounts for emissions per capita shows a different pattern, highlighting Neuquén Province, which, despite its low population density, exhibits high emissions due to industrial activity associated with the Vaca Muerta reservoir.

In Buenos Aires Province, emissions are heavily concentrated in the AMBA region due to its population density and industrial activity. However, other areas such as Bahía Blanca, an important logistical and industrial hub, and Olavarría, known for its cement industry, also stand out. In terms of per capita emissions, Ramallo in the north, with its low population and high emissions, and Tordillo, the least populated district in the province, emerge as notable cases.

Finally, the analysis of the AMBA shows Buenos Aires City as the leading emitter in the country. In Avellaneda, a historically industrial area, significant contributors include its petrochemical and tanning industries, as well as its container terminal, the largest in the country. Additionally, the municipalities of Campana and Zárate stand out, hosting some of the largest factories in the country in sectors such as steelmaking, automotive, and petrochemicals. When emissions are divided by population, Ensenada stands out due to its low population density and industrial development in the steel and petrochemical sectors, making it a significant per capita emitter.

This project combines technical skills in spatial data analysis with high-quality data to provide a meaningful environmental and urban diagnosis.
